# ddl.kxtz.dev

source code for the backend of dl.kxtz.dev

## Running the server

First of all, DO NOT MODIFY Dockerfile! IT IS DYNAMICALLY GENERATED BY `docker.sh`!

Second, this _requires_ Docker for security, and to run it is very simple,

Prereq:

- Have Docker installed

Now, run

```
bash docker.sh
```

and wait for it to finish, now the file server should be running on localhost:3069!
