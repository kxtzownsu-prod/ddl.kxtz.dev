# ddl.kxtz.dev

source code for the backend of dl.kxtz.dev

## Running the server

First of all, DO NOT MODIFY Dockerfile! IT IS DYNAMICALLY GENERATED BY `docker.sh`!

Second, this _requires_ Docker for security, and to run it is very simple,

Prereq:

- Have Docker installed

Now, run

```
bash docker.sh
```

and wait for it to finish, now the file server should be running on localhost:3069!

## Giving credits

If you use this project, according to the AGPL you must open source it.

If you are using a version of the project which falls before commit [7f6138a26150f74c51099ed6a5fd5df971960010](https://github.com/kxtzownsu-prod/ddl.kxtz.dev/commit/7f6138a26150f74c51099ed6a5fd5df971960010), then, from my limited knowledge of licenses, would fall under "All Rights Reserved" and I require you to update to the newest version which requires the AGPLv3.

If I'm wrong about the A.R.R, then please make an issue or PR and correct me.
